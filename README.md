# RadParcel:A Dashboard for Radionuclides Dispersion Simulations
**Version:** v0.0-beta

**RadParcel** is an interactive dashboard designed to track the dispersion of radionuclides in the ocean. Built with the power of the [**OceanParcels**](https://oceanparcels.org/) Langrangian Simulator, Python, and Plotly Dash, this project enables visualization and analysis of radionuclides trajectories and activity decay influenced by ocean currents.

## Features

- **Radionuclide Dispersion Simulation**: Simulate the movement and decay of radionuclides in realistic ocean currents.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Users can specify parameters such as release location, simulation duration, activity levels, and radionuclide half-life.
- **Realistic Ocean Data**: Utilizes Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS) datasets for ocean currents.
- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Interactive and animated trajectory maps powered by Plotly.
- **Export Results**: Saves particle trajectory data to Zarr format for post-processing and analysis.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.7+**
- [Parcels](https://oceanparcels.org/)
- Dash and Plotly  
- NumPy  
- Xarray

## **Hackathon Context**

This project was developed as part of [RAMONES Hackathon](https://sites.google.com/view/ramones-hackathon-2024/home) on December 4-5 at the Physics Department of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Our goal is to provide a scalable solution for tracking and visualizing radionuclide dispersion in oceans, aiding in environmental monitoring and risk assessment.
